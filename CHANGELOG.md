**version 0.1.6**: Corrected a test rerun bug as well as a problem with key control regex patterns; made a slight modification to key controls: T is no longer case-sensitive and will now rerun the top failed test result from the current set. To view the top failed result from the current set without rerunning, press SPACEBAR.
